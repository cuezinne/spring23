## `generatePOS(sentence)`

Given a string `sentence`, return an array of the part of speech (POS) of each word in the sentence. You may assume that the words in the sentence are in English, and each word is separated by exactly one space. There is no punctuation at the end of the sentence.

+ example: `generatePOS("the blue car")` -> `["DET", "ADJ", "NOU"]`

How would you implement `generatePOS`?

What data structure would you use to store the information about the words in the English language?
